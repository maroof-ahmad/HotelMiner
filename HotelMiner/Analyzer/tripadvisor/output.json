{"totalRating": "1", "reviewTitle": "Hopeless hospitality", "reviewContent": "I booked this hotel through Oyo Room with usual good experience from Oyo properties. But after reaching there, discovered that this hotel treats the Oyo guests in a different manner. The two persons in the reception (both day & night) have no sense of minimum hospitality. They behaved as if they are doing a favour by giving rooms to Oyo guests. I requested for a late check out and holding the room for 2.5 hrs. The reception person at night behaved like we are staying here on free basis and very rudely replied that we cant let u to hold your room, which otherwise is a very natural thing for any other hotel. In the morning also, the reception person after lot of requests said that well, maximum by 1pm you have to leave the room. He was not even bothered of small kids in such scorching summer. At 1 pm , I informed to the staffs regarding formalities for check out. However, there was no person available in the reception. He came at 1.20pm and told us very ill-mannerly that why you have not vacated your room till now ? So far we have never faced such disgusting treatment from any hotel anywhere in our life. I thought of slapping the person, but just said it is already informed , but you were not in your place.When we called them for location details, they replied very reluctantly two three words and simply disconnected the ph. This happened three times. So this is their nature.They keep the toiletries provided by Oyo Group for the rooms. Unless you demand for that, they wont provide you the same.They are list bothered to know whether you are comfortable with your room or not. If they have so much problem with people coming through Oyo website, they should not have the tie-ups.There are several other hotels nearby, you may check -in to any other. Donot opt for this property.First time I saw a hotel, which doesnot have any electric kettle and sachets for tea/coffee in the room. Now-a-days it is a very very common service.Their toilet is small beyond imagination.They counted for every small moves. Complimentary Breakfast is limited only to one item. They will not serve you even a butter cube extra. Moreover, restaurant is too small and not suitable to seat if two tables are occupied. They will not serve you cold water, you have to purchase that !!! Just imagine, what a torture in summer. Moreover, they will keep the plate in front of you and vanish. They dont know even that water is also needed to be served with the food.Only one staff in restaurant was good. He somehow arranged for cold water.After taking lunch we thought of sitting for sometime in the restaurant, but we were being asked to vacate the place immediately, as some group has checked-in and they need the place for them. Wonderful hospitality !!!!!!Lastly, dont go by the photo shown in Oyo website, rooms are one fourth of what is being shown there. I have stayed in lot of other Oyo properties, even in New Delhi. All of them are very good, nice staffs, warm hospitality. You will love to return there.But avoid this low graded cheap hotel totally, especially for the disgusting people sitting in their front office."},

{"totalRating": "1", "reviewTitle": "Hopeless hospitality", "reviewContent": "I booked this hotel through Oyo Room with usual good experience from Oyo properties. But after reaching there, discovered that this hotel treats the Oyo guests in a different manner. The two persons in the reception (both day & night) have no sense of minimum hospitality. They behaved as if they are doing a favour by giving rooms to Oyo guests. I requested for a late check out and holding the room for 2.5 hrs. The reception person at night behaved like we are staying here on free basis and very rudely replied that we cant let u to hold your room, which otherwise is a very natural thing for any other hotel. In the morning also, the reception person after lot of requests said that well, maximum by 1pm you have to leave the room. He was not even bothered of small kids in such scorching summer. At 1 pm , I informed to the staffs regarding formalities for check out. However, there was no person available in the reception. He came at 1.20pm and told us very ill-mannerly that why you have not vacated your room till now ? So far we have never faced such disgusting treatment from any hotel anywhere in our life. I thought of slapping the person, but just said it is already informed , but you were not in your place.When we called them for location details, they replied very reluctantly two three words and simply disconnected the ph. This happened three times. So this is their nature.They keep the toiletries provided by Oyo Group for the rooms. Unless you demand for that, they wont provide you the same.They are list bothered to know whether you are comfortable with your room or not. If they have so much problem with people coming through Oyo website, they should not have the tie-ups.There are several other hotels nearby, you may check -in to any other. Donot opt for this property.First time I saw a hotel, which doesnot have any electric kettle and sachets for tea/coffee in the room. Now-a-days it is a very very common service.Their toilet is small beyond imagination.They counted for every small moves. Complimentary Breakfast is limited only to one item. They will not serve you even a butter cube extra. Moreover, restaurant is too small and not suitable to seat if two tables are occupied. They will not serve you cold water, you have to purchase that !!! Just imagine, what a torture in summer. Moreover, they will keep the plate in front of you and vanish. They dont know even that water is also needed to be served with the food.Only one staff in restaurant was good. He somehow arranged for cold water.After taking lunch we thought of sitting for sometime in the restaurant, but we were being asked to vacate the place immediately, as some group has checked-in and they need the place for them. Wonderful hospitality !!!!!!Lastly, dont go by the photo shown in Oyo website, rooms are one fourth of what is being shown there. I have stayed in lot of other Oyo properties, even in New Delhi. All of them are very good, nice staffs, warm hospitality. You will love to return there.But avoid this low graded cheap hotel totally, especially for the disgusting people sitting in their front office."},

The customer service said something on which they didnot act. They charged extra without giving a prior notice. Food taste was very normal owing to its high charges. I would strongly discourage to stay here. Locality very congested."},
